    "This post aims to explain what a language model is and how we can build a simple one. You have likely heard or read news about Language Models, especially Large Language Models (or LLMs for short), frequently these days since the release of <b>ChatGPT</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>ChatGPT</b>, which is built on top of LLMs like GPT-4, has become a notable example in the field. In this notebook, I will show you how to construct a language model from scratch. As we proceed step by step, I'll also discuss some considerations and challenges associated with building and training such models, as well as how the experts in the field have addressed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Should I build my own language model?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably not! Building a language model, especially a large one, from scratch is often not practical for most individuals or even small teams. This is because training such models requires extensive computational resources and large, high-quality datasets. Instead, many people opt to use pre-trained models and fine-tune them for specific tasks. However, even fine-tuning can be computationally expensive and may not yield good results if your dataset is small due to the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why should I then bother to learn how language models are built? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the mechanics of language models can empower you to use them more effectively. When you're implementing these models in real-world scenarios, having a solid foundational knowledge will help you troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about which model to use and how to adapt it for your specific needs."

    "A language model is a probability distribution over a sequence of tokens drawn from a specific vocabulary. For example, if we consider the vocabulary to be the English language, then a sequence of tokens could be the sentence 'The sky is blue.'\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What does it mean when we say, 'A language model is a probability distribution,' and how can we utilize this concept?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, considering the vocabulary $V$, for every sequence of tokens $x_1,...x_m$, where each token $x_i \\in V $, a language model is defined by the probability distribution $p(x_1,x_2,...,x_m)$. In other words, $p(x_1,x_2,...,x_m)$ tells us how likely a sequence of tokens is to be observed. Of cource, we expect that this probability distribution assigns a high probability to correct sequences while giving small probability to incorrect or meaningless sequences. For example, we expect $p(.)$ to give a higher probability to 'The sky is blue' in comparison to 'A sky was the blue'\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's delve into some mathematics to see what we can drive from $p(.)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the chain rule of probability, we can rewrite $p(x_1,x_2,...,x_m)$ as follows:\n",
    "$$p(x_{1:m})=p(x_1)p(x_2∣x_1)p(x_3∣x_1,x_2)⋯p(x_m∣x_{1:m−1})=\\prod_{i=1}^m p(x_i∣x_{1:i−1}).$$\n",
    "Here, each term in the multiplication represents the conditional probability of the current token given the previous tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the conditional probability $p(x_i∣x_{1:i−1})$ means that given the sequence $x_1,...,x_{i−1}$, we can sample the next token $x_i$ from the vocabulary, and then sample another one, and so on. Sampling the tokens one after another implies that we are <b><i>generating</i></b> a sequence of vocabularies or in other words, we are <b><i>generating</i></b> a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Now, one key question to ask is, 'Do we know this probability distribution?' if not, Can we estimate it? </b>    \n",
    "The answer to the first question is 'No! We do not.' The answer to the latter one is 'Yes! We can.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, before the rise of advanced NLP techniques, n-gram language modeling was a popular approach to approximate these probabilities. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of 'n' items from a given sample of text. For example, in a bigram model (where n=2), we'd use the probability of a word appearing after its preceding word to estimate $p(x_i∣x_{1:i−1})$. In a trigram model (where n=3), we use the previous two words. These models were constructed by analyzing vast amounts of text and <b>counting</b> the frequencies of word sequences. However, n-gram models have their limitations, especially when dealing with long dependencies between words, since they only consider a fixed number of preceding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Deep Neural Networks, especially Transformers, come to the rescue. These modern architectures, which are mainly based on Transformers, are designed to capture broader and more nuanced textual contexts than traditional n-gram models. Using self-attention mechanisms, which are the key componenents of the Transformer architectures, they consider relationships between all words in a sentence, enabling them to recognize long-range dependencies. Moreover, they do not just count word sequences; they learn abstract patterns and deep structures within the language. This combination of wider context understanding and depth of learning allows them to more accurately reflect and generate the multifaceted intricacies of natural language can consider much wider contexts and more abstract patterns in the data, making them better suited for estimating the intricate probability distributions that govern natural language."

    "NLP tasks, such as Language Modeling and Machine Translation, require analyzing data sequentially. Traditional feedforward neural networks are not capable of handling dependencies in sequential data, as they lack any memory of previous inputs. This is where RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), and later on, Transformers, come into the scene. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs are able to maintain a hidden state that acts as a form of memory, enabling them to capture information about previous inputs in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This characteristic makes RNNs well-suited for various tasks. For example, they are ideal for text generation and machine translation. Due to their ability to model temporal dependencies, they can be used for forecasting stock prices, weather, and other time-dependent phenomena. The sequential nature of audio signals makes RNNs valuable for speech recognition tasks. Additionally, they can analyze sequences of video frames to recognize actions or gestures over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, traditional RNNs suffered from problems like vanishing or exploding gradients, making them difficult to train on long sequences. This led to the development of more advanced types of RNNs, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are designed to better capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. While LSTMs and GRUs are designed to capture long-range dependencies, they may still be challenged by the inherent sequential nature of their processing, limiting their parallelization efficiency and potentially affecting their ability to model extremely complex dependencies. In contrast, Transformers use a self-attention mechanism that allows them to directly model relationships between all parts of the input sequence, regardless of distance. This parallel processing enables more efficient training and can provide Transformers with a significant advantage in tasks requiring a nuanced understanding of context and long-range interactions between elements in a sequence."

As opposed to sequential models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, Transformers are able to process an entire sequence of data simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n",
    "The core of the Transformer architecture is the attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input (e.g. different tokens in a sequence of tokens) when processing each individual element (e.g., a token). This enables the Transformer to capture complex relationships and dependencies between all parts of the input, regardless of their distance from each other in the sequence.\n",

    "A typical Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of several layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The encoder processes the input sequence (e.g. an English sentence), and the decoder generates the output (e.g. the equivalent French translation of the input), with attention mechanisms at each layer allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input as needed\n",

In essence, every language has an associated probability distribution, though its exact nature remains unknown to us. Techniques like the N-gram method or deep learning allow us to approximate this distribution. When employing deep neural networks in this domain, the loss function used is cross entropy. This metric evaluates the difference between the true probability distribution, which is unknown, and the distribution predicted by the language model. When assessing a language model, our primary interest lies in its performance on unseen data—specifically, the sentences in the test set. A lower cross entropy indicates a model that's less \"perplexed\" and more certain in its predictions. Therefore, perplexity is defined as:"
