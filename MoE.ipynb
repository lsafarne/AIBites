    "In this post, I will delve into two advanced methodologies in machine learning: the Mixture of Experts (MoEs) and Switch Transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mixture of Experts (MoEs) approach proposes the idea of utilizing an ensemle of specialized models, where each model excels in a particular domain. For language modeling, this means employing multiple models, each adept at capturing specific linguistic nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switch Transformers, a variant of the MoEs approach, offer a distinctive modification to the traditional transformer architecture. By introducing efficiencies and optimizations, they further enhance the overall performance of models.\" Using Switch Transformers, a language model can be scaled up substantially, resulting in enhancing the overall performance of models.\n",
